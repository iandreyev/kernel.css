Introduction
============

What is it?
-----------
The kernel.css framework is a unintrusive, lightweight and semantic CSS and JavaScript framework
inspired by the [material design spec](https://material.io/guidelines). It uses prefixes for all it's classes. It's meant to be
a foundation to your projects, and not a complete product.

Features
--------
 * Includes all the main colors specified in the material design colors spec.
 * Grid system based on flexbox.
 * Navigation with four preset sizes (ion-header-xs, ion-header-sm, ion-header-lg, ion-header-xl).
 * Cubic-bezier transitions.

Why was it created?
-------------------
kernel.css was originally created for the Ionogy [Libre](https://ionogy.com/libre) project.
We needed a framework that could be used for creating everything from websites to webapps, and the likes.
It also had to be customizable in order to let users
style their application how they wanted, but no other frameworks fit those requirements well enough.
That is why it was decided to release it as a standalone project.

It's far from finished
------------------------
The kernel.css framework is an ever evolving project, and will
continue to be improved upon. We hope you will find it useful.

Installation
============
Simple. Just include these tags in your html.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://ionogy.com/kernel.css/v0.6.0/kernel.min.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ionogy.com/kernel.css/v0.6.0/kernel.js"></script>
```

Navigation code example
-----------
```
<body class="ion-base">
  <header class="ion-header ion-header-sm">
    <div class="ion-header-brand">kernel.css</div>

    <button class="nav-toggle">
        <i class="material-icons">menu</i>
    </button>

    <div class="ion-container">
      <nav class="ion-nav">
        <ul>
          <li class="ion-nav-active-state"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Download</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Wiki</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">About us</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <nav class="ion-nav ion-float-right">
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Blog</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </div>
  </header>
</body>
```
